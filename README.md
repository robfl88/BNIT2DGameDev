Repository for Building IT Systems game development 

Hi everyone! Welcome to our Building IT Systems Unity repo.

A quick note on version control. I'm going to split the repo into two branches initialliy, master and indevelopment. Master will essentially be our major revisions. As we reach major project milestones, the in-development branch will be merged into the master branch as a major revision.

EG: master branch major revision 1.0, in-development branch will increment 1.1, 1.2, until it reaches milestone 2.0 then it will be merged back with master.

We will need to decide what each version increment will look like and how each of the tasks will be split at each stage. This can be discussed during our group meetings. Revison notes shall be kept in this readme.
